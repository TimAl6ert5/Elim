# Future tasks

- Research Incidence Matrix representation
- Calculate vertex degree (number of edges connected to a vertex)
- Determine if graph has Eulerian Walk (number of odd degree vertices is 0 or 2)
- Export one representation to another
- Optimize graph properties
	- save property so it isn't calculated on every read
	- use lazy init on graph properties
- Implement graph structure
